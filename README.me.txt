This repository is my solution to all assignments of the Machine Learning course (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. I think it will be very beneficial for anyone who wants to start a ML-related career to begin with this course. After completing this course, you will understand many fundamental concepts of ML in the right way. Although I think it is essential and useful to know about some basic ideas in Linear Algebra, Statistic and Probability, and Convex Optimization for an excellent grasp of the course's main concepts.
