# ML_coursera
This repository contains all my implementations of programming exercises from Coursera's Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.
The course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition.



# My Learning from the Course


**1.Supervised Learning**

* Parametric/Non-parametric Algorithms
* Support Vector Machines and Kernels
* Neural Networks

**2.Unsupervised Learning**

* Clustering (k-means)
* Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
* Anomaly Detection (Density Estimation)
* Recommender Systems (Collaborative Filtering)

**3.Best Practices in Machine Learning**

* Evaluating a Learning Algorithm
* Diagnosing Bias Vs Variance and Regularization
* Learning Curves and Debugging a Learning Algorithm
* Error Analysis
* Error Metrics for Skewed Classes (or Trading off Precision and Recall)

**4.Numerous Case Studies and Applications from Different Areas**

* Automated Handwritten Digit Recognition (with NN)
* Spam Email Classification (with SVM)
* Image Compression (with k-means algorithm)
* Deminsionality Reduction of Face Image Dataset (with PCA)
* Movie Recommendation System (with Collaborative Filtering)
