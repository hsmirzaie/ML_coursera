# ML_coursera
This repository contains all my implementations of programming exercises from Coursera's ***Machine Learning course*** taught by *Andrew Ng*.
The course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining and statistical pattern recognition.

# My Comment
I think it will be very beneficial for anyone who wants to start a ML-related career to begin with this course. After completing this course, you will understand many fundamental concepts of ML in the right way. Although I think it is essential and useful to know some basic ideas in **Linear Algebra**, **Statistic and Probability**, and **Convex Optimization** for an excellent grasp of the course's main concepts.




# My Learning from the Course


**1.Supervised Learning**

* Parametric/Non-parametric Algorithms
* Support Vector Machines and Kernels
* Neural Networks

**2.Unsupervised Learning**

* Clustering (K-means Algorithm)
* Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
* Anomaly Detection (Density Estimation)
* Recommender Systems (Collaborative Filtering)

**3.Best Practices in Machine Learning**

* Evaluating a Learning Algorithm
* Diagnosing Bias Vs Variance and Regularization
* Learning Curves and Debugging a Learning Algorithm
* Error Analysis
* Error Metrics for Skewed Classes (or Trading off Precision and Recall)

**4.Numerous Case Studies and Applications from Different Areas**

* Automated Handwritten Digit Recognition (with NN)
* Spam Email Classification (with SVM)
* Image Compression (with K-means algorithm)
* Deminsionality Reduction of Face Image Dataset (with PCA)
* Movie Recommendation System (with Collaborative Filtering)
